      "message": "Is the check necessary? We don\u0027t fetch the changelog unless we received a good response from the server for a specific UpdateInfo. Any ACTION_CANCEL_CHECK sent to the service would cancel all the queued requests, including pending changelog files. I have a new patchset which addresses an NPE regarding the cancelAll, but I don\u0027t completely understand why we shouldn\u0027t fetch a changelog for an UpdateInfo we already received information about.\n\nAn alternative means of stopping the queuing of the requests is to just call stop on the RequestQueue itself whenever ACTION_CANCEL_CHECK occurs, but I\u0027m not sure if I like that.",

      "message": "Given that the old code just call abort inside this method and nobody claims about ANR or crashes in this method, i don\u0027t think that holding the UI is a matter a here. Is just a question of milliseconds to abort the download. It just need to be done in a separete thread.\nCreating a AsyncTask just for a task of milliseconds, which will need a lock to ensure that the service don\u0027t be killed is a lot of code for me just for a simple task. My actual patch have wait just for the abort and not more than 5000 (the ANR timeout).\n\nDanny, anyway, if you still want to see an AyncTask i have no problem to change it.",
